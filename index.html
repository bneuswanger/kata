    <h1>Code Challenges!</h1>
    <h3>Many of these come from Kata, others from Discord conversations, etc.</h3>
    <h2>My Completed Challenges:</h2>
    <h3>1) Given 2 arrays of numbers, return the first array with any values from the second array removed.</h3>
    <h3>2) Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.</h3>
    <h3>3) Some numbers have funny properties. For example:<br>
        89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1<br>
        695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2<br>
        46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51<br>
        Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such that the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k * n.<br>
        In other words:<br>
        Is there an integer k such as : (a ^ p + b ^ (p+1) + c ^(p+2) + d ^ (p+3) + ...) = n * k
        If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.
        Note: n and p will always be given as strictly positive integers.</h3>
    <h3>4) Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. An integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer. If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.</h3>
    <h3>5) Given a random string with letters, numbers, and/or symbols, return a string of numbers separated by spaces such that each letter of the original string is replaced by it's corresponding number in the alphabet: "a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc. The string "baa!" should return "2 1 1".</h3>
    <h3>6) Given a string of words, write a function that returns true if the string contains all the letters of the alphabet. Return false if it does not.</h3>
    <h3>7) Given a name in string format, capitalize the first letter of all words unless the word is "van", "den", "der", "de", or "ter"</h3>
    <h3>8) Write a function to test whether a string if a string is a palindrome. Return true or false. Common interview question!</h3>
